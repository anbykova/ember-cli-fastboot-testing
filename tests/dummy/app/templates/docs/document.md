# Document tests

There are some HTML elements generated by FastBoot that cannot be rendered inside of Ember's testing container. For example, rendering a FastBoot generated `<head>` tag inside of the testing container would result in an invalid HTML document. A `<head>` tag inside of a `<div>`, that's nonsense!

However, a common use case for FastBoot is to generate `head`, `title`, and `meta` tags for crawlers and bots, so it would make sense to want to test that these tags are rendered correctly.

To write these sort of tests, use the `htmlDocument` returned from `visit` to get a `Document` object that you can assert against with `qunit-dom`.

```js
import { module, test, skip } from 'qunit';
import { setup, visit } from 'ember-cli-fastboot-testing/test-support';

module('FastBoot | document test', function(hooks) {
  setup(hooks);

  test('it renders the correct og:title', async function(assert) {
    let { htmlDocument } = await visit('/');

    assert
      .dom('head meta[property="og:title"]', htmlDocument)
      .hasAttribute('content', 'Fastboot testing');
  });
});
```
